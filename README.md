# Review Grid
Review Grid is a page made from Udemy Course: TailwindCSS from Scratch.

This is a grid design for a review aggregation site (the ones that collect user and expert reviews). This project utilizes TailwindCLI. This also uses a tailwind plugin called line-clamp.

This oage design is made to imitate common review sites, or testimonial sections for a service or a product.

The design is based from Frontend Mentor. The modifications are performed such that it seems a review aggregation for the movie 'Zodiac'.
